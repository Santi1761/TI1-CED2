[[This is our team E-19]](https://classroom.github.com/a/LMwH6w7l)

This repository contains solutions to three divide and conquer problems implemented in Scala using functional programming techniques. The project is a collaboration between:

Santiago Arboleda Velasco - A00369824
Camilo Bueno - A00219928
Daron Mercado - A00395421

All stundents of University Icesi. It was a great activity to do, it pushed us to the limit when it came to thinking and designing a solution for these problems. We believe that the result was satisfactory.

To review the designs (with test design, demonstrations and complexity) that were made in this delivery you can check these links:

1)

[Review the code of point 1 (Binary Search)](https://github.com/Bloque-CED/2023-2ti1-entregafinal-e-19/blob/main/doc/Desing_BinarySearch.md)


2)
[Review the code of point 2 (Majority Element)](https://github.com/Bloque-CED/2023-2ti1-entregafinal-e-19/blob/main/doc/Desing_MajorityElem.md)


3)
[Review the code of point 3 (Organice Lotery)](https://github.com/Bloque-CED/2023-2ti1-entregafinal-e-19/blob/main/doc/Design_Lotery.md)
